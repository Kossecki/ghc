        GHC started as a project of two friends and passionate baristas, John &#38; Don in 2010. Believing as
        much in the hand of an educated barista as in the innovative equipment of our ever-growing industry,
        GHC offers a full spectrum of brewing opportunitiesâ€”from pour overs to syphon pots to finely executed
        espresso beverages. Each cup of coffee is made with love, precision and care.
