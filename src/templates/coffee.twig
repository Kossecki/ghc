    <h1>Coffee</h1>
    <p>
        We work with specialty coffee from current crops which is carefully roasted. Our coffee is fruity, juicy
        and never boring. We bring you the best from leading European specialty roasteries, currently mostly
        from Square Mile Coffee Roasters, a multi award winning coffee roasting company based in East London.
        You can currently buy these beans in 350g bags.

    <p>
        <span>redcurrant/honeysuckle/juicy</span>
        Fruity redcurrant and sweet honeysuckle flavours. An incredibly juicy coffee which we struggled to
        decide on the right berry descripton, but raspberry, blackberry and blueberry were also in the running!

    <h2>Mormora (Ethiopia)</h2>

    <p>
        <span>blackberry/orange/silky</span>
        Fruity, sweet notes of dried mango, strawberry and passionfruit sit alongside a delicious creamy
        mouthfeel making this a tasty summer Ethiopian, hot or cold.

    <h2>Kamwangi (Kenya)</h2>

    <p>
        <span>blackberry/orange/silky</span>
        This is one fruit filled espresso! From citrus fruits, such as orange, grapefruit and clementine, to
        berries of the black, blue and red variety, this is fruit turned up to 11, all wrapped up in a silky
        smooth body.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span>caramel/apple/cinnamon</span>
        This is a single origin espresso from San Carlos in El Salvador, think sweet caramel and apple notes
        alongside sprinklings of cinnamon in the finish.
